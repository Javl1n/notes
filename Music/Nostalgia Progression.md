# Relative Multipolar Tonality
when you play a song all notes come from a single key

but with **RMT** you mix and match chords from relative major and minor

Relative keys are the major and minor keys that share all the same notes
example: C Major and A minor

exception:  you can raise the 7th tone to lead more satisfactory back to the root, if you do this you change the fifth chord of the minor key from Major to minor (Em -> Emaj). aslo called Harmonic Minor Scale. The fifth major chord is used often.

Relative Multipolar Rule:
	Change the minor third to major.

RMT raise: lift and Energy
RMT lower: melancholy nostalgic (IV - iv)

RMT raise: I - V - vi - III - I - V - vi - III
RMT lower: I - III - IV - iv - I
