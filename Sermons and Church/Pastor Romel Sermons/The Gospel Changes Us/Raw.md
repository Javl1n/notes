Lord’s Day Preaching - The Gospel Changes Us.

When we talk about Christian giving, madalas na nakakabit sa usaping yan is stewardship, over the years ng pag study ko sa scripture, napansin ko na yung mga behaviour na yan and teachings is always rooted at something katulad ng 1 Corinthians 8 and 9, pag nakarating ka sa dulo ng passages na yan na patungkol sa stewardship and giving, sinasabi doon na ang generosity natin should flow from our holding on to the gospel. Pero ano nga ba ang ibig sabihin niyan? Ibig sabihin lang ba niyan that the gospel is about Jesus Christ giving himself up so we try very hard to live like Jesus? sa pagbibigay natin, we are trying to be like Jesus? It's got to mean more than that.

-Ang ibig sabihin nyan is that the gospel changes the heart in a deep and profound way, ngayon yung generosity natin..and all the things that we should be doing, sa church, sa community, sa family natin..is a result, na yung mga barriers that are keeping us to be generous are taken away.

-Ngayon if the gospel has really and profoundly changed you, you will just be generous.

-This morning let us go to the heart of this, kung ano nga ba ang ibig sabihin at tunay na kahulugan ng pagchange ng gospel sa ating mga puso.

-over the years sa Christian life ko and as a pastor, I have seen people that are trying really hard to change..

-sa iba't ibang dahilan, narerealize nila na kailangan nilang magbago

-why is it that a lot of people, makikita natin kahit sa mga kasimbahanan..sinasabi nila that "I have to change", alam nila for various reasons, naiintindihan nila that they are not being good and that they have to change, and we can see a lot of people surrender, pray, give their lives, seek to change and some do and some don't?

-I was reading about Jonathan Edwards, a great english teacher, preacher and theologian, nakita niya in their place sa North Hampton Massachussets, he has seen great revivals in his time but it dawned on him na maraming mga tao really were changed by the gospel and more people claims to want change, talk about it and went back to their old lives.

-what does it really mean to be changed by the gospel? is it really just trying hard to live a good life? 

-I was inspired sa napakagandang preaching ni Ptr. Johndel last time about Romans 7, marami akong natutunan and this morning we will be looking at what "NOT TO DO" in order to be changed by the gospel.

-over the years, I have been convinced na napakaimportante sa Christian life natin itong paguusapan natin ngayong umagang ito. We have to see our natural tendencies.

-let me read to you some passages out of Romans 7:4-6 and verse 18-25”

-4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. 6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.

18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!

-This morning I will give you three headings..

-What is the greatest source of our troubles.

-What not to do to resolve the source of this trouble.

-What ultimately can resolve this? How the gospel changes us.

-1.What is the greatest source of our troubles?

-Diretso na sinabi ni Paul, there is huge EVIL living inside of him, far more evil than anybody really really believes. Si John Newton yung nagsulat ng "amazing grace" na hymn sabi niya in one of his writings "no one ever learns that they are sinners by being told...you have to be shown"

-all of us are created in the image of God as Genesis 1:26-27 says, that includes our reason,morality, relational capacity, dominion and a capacaity for spiritual communion with God.

-However, after the fall, in Genesis 3, sin corrupted us. Although the image of God was not destroyed, but it was marred and corrupted by sin.

-James 3:9 affirms this even after the fall. "With the tongue we bless our lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God" -so the image remains-but is no longer pure.

-Now the question is, how about our choosing? How about our wills? Araw-araw we are choosing things, we are making choices..we do have that capacity, however..in terms of spiritual things and going to God, we no longer have that capacity for we are dead in our trespasses and someone from outside of us should intervene. We will get back to this later..

-Now, Paul is basically saying that we are far more evil, far wicked than you want to believe. Pwede mo sabihin na naniniwala ka na masama ka, but in reality you don't believe it. Alam mo na masama ka, but you don't have the slightest idea how evil you can really be. There is evil living in you.

-Remember in Luke 11, (.13) where Jesus Christ was talking to His disciples about prayer, at may isang point doon sa mga sinabi niya sa mga disciples nya, If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”

-you who are evil, YOU are evil. Si Kristo mismo nagsabi nito, sa mga apostles niya! Jesus so assumes that His apostles are thoroughly evil, that we are all fallen and evil.

-Sabi ni Paul "because evil dwell in us, we cannot change, because we do not know the extent and the gravity of our fallenness"

-In our greatest, gaano pa ka galing at ka buti ang tingin natin sa ating mga sarili. Reality will just slap us in the face that we don't really know how evil we can be.

-I have been reading one of this great classic novels, ang title "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. Sinulat ito ni Robert Louis Stevenson, 80 pages long, at napakagandang read nya..and it is actually based in Romans 7 kung babasahin nyo siya.

-Si Dr. Jekyl, is a good man, pero naka conclude siya na may dark side sa loob niya na naghohold-back sa kaniya in doing the things na gusto nyang gawin at ma achieve, and at one point sabi niya

"with everyday I drew steadily nearer to that truth that man is not truly one, but two. I saw that of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness even if I can be rightly said to be either only because I was radically both.

-Sinasabi ni Dr. Jekyl that he is good but he also knows he is radically evil and that evil is pulling him back and keeping him to do things na gusto nyang gawin.

-So nagkaroon siya ng idea, gumawa siya ng isang potion, at yung potion na yun ang mag seseparate nung evil and good, so yung evil side nya lalabas pag gabi in a distinct personality and then in the day Dr. Jekyl will be absolutely good, free from the gravitational pull of the evil within him, malaya siyang namumuhay

-Pero, pero..nung ininom nya na yung potion, it dawned on him na nagkamali siya, na namis-calculate nya lahat. Kasi yung evil side nya, si Mr. Hyde was waaay to evil than he has expected

-at sinasabi nya na pag nagiging si Mr.Hyde siya "I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that

moment, braced and delighted me like wine."

-Si Edward Hyde, yung alter-ego niya is inherently malign, his every act and thought is centered completely on the self.

-At nung narealize na nga ni Dr. jekyl na yung evil side nya ay hindi lang bastang masama, kundi napakasama, and it becomes to take over, pumapatay na siya ng mga tao, eventually he loses control and eventually nagpakamatay siya and we will get back to it in a minute

-Now, Robert Louis Stevenson, understood that "we can't change" at isa sa napakalaking dahilan nun is we think we can. Wala tayong idea kung gaano tayo kasama, it is all within us.

-So katulad ni Paul, ang gustong sabihin sa atin ng author ng book, is that "even the best of us. Dr. jekyls, St. Pauls..don't even know how evil you are.

-Si Sufjan Stevens is an american-indie rockstar, Christian siya, mayroon siyang ginawang kanta and the title is John Wayne Gacey Jr.

-isa itong kanta about a serial killer in the U.S...then na review siya ng Village Voice sa New York, ni review nila yung kanta..alam nila na Christian si Stevens, even though di sila naga agree sa views niya, nakaingun sila na isang masterpiece yung kanta na yun and they knew that the song is a radical statement about the Christian doctrine of evil and human sin.

-it is about John Wayne Gacey Jr. pumatay siya ng maraming mga batang lalaki sa US, tapos tinatago niya yung mga katawan ng mga biktima niya sa ilalim ng floorboards ng front poarch niya. Nagsusuot siya ng clown costume, akala ng mga tao napakabait niya na tao, nag aarrange siya ng mga kid's party. But behind it all of this, he was murdering people, yung kanta duet siya..may second voice, and sa pinakadulo na line ng kanta, si Sufjan nalang kumakanta, and the line goes like this..

"And in my best behavior I am really just like him

Look beneath the floorboards

For the secrets I have hid"

-what Sufjan is saying is that ultimately ang pagkakaiba lang niya doon sa serial killer is that, the serial killers had this chance, for the evil in them to sprout and to grow..it's like a seed that is all within us. With good conditions, madiligan maayo, malagyan ng fertilizer..and it will grow..

-these seeds that are all in our hearts, in the right situation, the right amount of self-centeredness, we are all self-centered, all of us are self-absorbed. Every thought centered about ourselves. Ganun yung pagpicture out kay Edward Hyde..a very selfish individual.. "how do i look, how am I doing? How is it working out for me.." Pare-parehas tayong mayroon ng seed na yun sa ating mga kasing-kasing and we all can be serial killers if the situation is right.

-Lahat tayo ay mga Edward Hyde..at katulad ng sinasabi sa kanta, beneath the floorboards of our lives, there is horrible evil.

-Jeremiah 17:9 "the heart is deceitful above all else, and desperately sick, who can understand it?" not even you!

-sa ilalim ng mga salog nato, hindi nakikita ng ibang mga tao..and unless we come to understand one thing, we cannot make any progress..ano yung one thing na yun?

-i'll tell you in a minute, but we have to be shown how evil we are..and in that condition how hopeless and helpless we are on our own.

-we may think that we are good, lumaki ako sa simbahan, studied the bible..wala akong ginagawang masama, pinalaki ako ng maayos ng magulang ko. Hindi ako breaker ng rules. Christian ka, non-christian..it's the same.

-isa ito sa mga dilemma at burden ng mga Christian parents sa america noong pumutok yung sex, drugs and rock and roll culture sa bansa nila.

-reklamo sila sa mga pastors and elders nila sa church, about their children, pinalaki nila ng maayos, driven them to God's word, hindi nakakalimutang paalalahanan sila ng paulit-ulit, pero bakit yung mga anak nila na hindi nila ineexpect na makagawa ng mga ganung baga, eh nahuhulog sa sala? Why are they seem to be more rebellious? We don't know how evil we can be..

-or it can be the other way around, na alam natin na masama tayo..alam natin lahat in our minds that we are sinful, our hearts are not good. We know it all in our heads. At kahit anong gawin natin, hindi natin kayang baguhin ang mga sarili natin.

-Mas maiintindihan natin ito sa extent and effect ng addiction..kung alam lang natin ang extent ng kayang gawin ng isang tao, to do evil things..

-So there we are radical evil and also we do not see the extent of that evil within us.

-Now at some point narerealize natin that there is something wrong, may it be that you are a christian or non-christian

-we study the bible, we know that we are all sinful, we know these things in our head..pero..

-balik tayo kay John Newton, "no one ever learns that they are sinners by being told" you got to be shown..

-pero ito na, most of the time kusa siyang lumalabas..most of the time without us knowing. May mga potions sa kinabuhi nato.. May mga nangyayari sa buhay natin na nagttrigger ng emotions natin, Something comes in your life, a really hard to love person, difficult marriage, problema sa business, a temptation..then you realize na oopps kailangan ko magbago kailangan ko baguhin sarili ko..

Ang tanong, do you really see your radical condition in sin? o andoon pa din tayo sa illusion natin na, "mabuti naman akong tao", hindi naman ako pumapatay? wala naman akong tinatapakang tao?..or we can already see, na hindi naman talaga ito issue ng tinatapakang tao, kundi kung sino yung banal na Diyos na pinagrebeldehan natin?

ito yung main thrust ng mga sinasabi ko sa inyo ngayon

2. What not to do to resolve the source of this trouble. (What will not solve our problem of evil)

-So Robert Louis Stevenson sa Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde shows this in an amazing way pero si Apostle Paul basically says, "what you do, pag narerealize mo na kung gaano ka kasama, is you go to the moral law, to the 10 commandments. "You say, na magpapakabuti ako, i'll work this thing out"..so mostly ang response nating mga evangelical christians is this, "i'm gonna give my life to Christ, i'll recommit in a new way, i'll read my bible, i'll have my devotionals, i'm gonna really surrender and confess all known sin, I'm really gonna walk by the Spirit, I will do everything just right..now Paul, when he says we turn to the law, para maresolbahan yung problem ng sin and our heart, he is talking about the Mosaic law.

-Sabi ni C.S. Lewis sa appendix ng "Abolition of Man" sabi niya every religion in the world, including Christianity agree on what a moral life ought to be..be generous sa mga mahihirap, be sexually faithful, devoted to God, honoring your parents, tell the truth, love your neighbor. May universal concensus ang moral law..

-so sa evangelical version natin, confess all known sin, walk in the Spirit and really really surrender to Christ. May buddhist approach din, secular approach, we all turn to the law. However Paul says trying to obey the law, trying to deal with your inner problems with the law, makes them worst. Always...let me explain..si Paul ang nagsabi nito ha, hindi po ako. "we were controlled by the sinful nature and by the sinful passions aroused by the law..

-Listen carefully. Paul acknowledges that the law itself cannot eradicate the sinful nature of humanity. Paul suggests that the law's prohibitions and requirements can stir up sinful desires within a person. It's not that the law causes sin, but rather, it exposes it and can intensify the desire to break it.

-Sinasabi ni Paul that the mosaic law, the commandments, when you try to apply it sa kagustuhan mo na magbago, through acts of the will, to your heart.."mayroon siyang "green house effect" sa sinful passions natin..it will not just fail to work, it makes it worst.

-Si St. Augustine, sa book niya the "confessions" kinwento niya yung isang episode sa buhay niya when he was still a young boy, nagapangawat siya ng mga peras (pears) sa isang pear orchard..then later on in his life sa reflections niya, nakapangutana siya, "bakit ako nagnanakaw ng peras? una sa lahat, sa panahong yun..hindi naman siya gutom? at pangalawa ito matindi.."hindi ko din gusto kumain ng peras" I hate it. And he came into conclusion na ang reason why he steal pears is that he was told not to do it. May something sa heart niya, na nagsasabi "nobody tells me how to live" so when the law came, it aroused that.

-May sinabi si Paul sa chapter 7, sabi niya ganito "i was alive apart from the law, but when the command "thou shall not covet" came home, it slew me and I died. Anong ibig sabihin nito, wag natin kalimutan kung ano si Paul dati, he was a pharisee, expert of the law.."faithfully" keeping the law, feeling niya perfect niya tanan. did not commit adultery, did not kill, don't worship false gods, sa templo lang ako pumupunta.,.,but when he got to the last commandment, "thou shall not covet" he was forced to see that this is the only commandment that deals with the emotions of the heart. Dili behavior and motivation..basically ang ibig sabihin we should be loving God so much, that we have to be contented with what we have.

-Narealize ni Paul, looking into his heart, he died. Why? IF the essence of sin is self-centeredness, self absorbtion, that everything has to revolve around you..

-ang ibig sabihin pala nun ganito, sinusunod niya lang pala ang law, sinusunod niya ang mga commandments because he wanted to make God have to bless him, "I am a great person because I obey the law," God has to bless me because I obey the law.

-if we are doing good for us to feel good about ourselves, that "i obey the law, then God has to bless me, people needs to respect me, magiging self-righteous ka na, then you begin to feel anxious kasi hindi mo alam kung na mamaintain mo ba yung "kabutihan mo" nagkukulang ba or ano..and it makes you angry, kasi ngayon pag mayroon ng mangyayaring hindi maganda sa buhay mo you will say "mabuting tao ako ah, Lord, ano ba to? bakit ganito? I try so hard to be good., you start to compare with other people... you are now looking down at people from your moral high horse.

-Balik tayo sa Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, nagdecide si Dr. Jekyl na tabunan niya ng kabutihan yung alter-ego niya si Mr. Hyde sabi niya..

"I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others..

"It was a fine clear January day, i felt i've gotten on top of Edward Hyde, and I sat in a park smiling, and comparing myself with other men, comparing my act of goodwill with the lazy cruelty of their neglect, and at that very moment that vain glorious thought, a qualm came over me, a hard nausea and a deadly shuddering, I was once more Edward Hyde.

-For the very first time, he became Edward Hyde without the potion. Why? Sa kagustuhan ni Dr. Jekyl na ibaon at matabunan ng sobrang kabutihan niya si Edward Hyde, he wanted to be so good that Edward Hyde will not be able to show up.

-sa kagustuhan ni Dr. Jekykl na maging sobrang mabuti, what we are doing is this,we try so hard, we want to be so good, we have now the pride, the vain glory from being incredibly good is just another way for us to be self-centered. Another way to make the world miserable with another self-centered person.

-There is two ways for us to be our own savior and Lord..two ways to be YOUR OWN SAVIOR instead of Christ being your savior. One is going out, at sundin mo at pagustuhan mo yung evil desires and passions mo, para maging masama, the other is by being incredibly good, being incredibly moral..being incredibly surrendered..being incredibly generous..

-SO pag ganun yung tingin natin sa sarili natin," God has to bless me" God has to answer my prayers, people has to respect me. This is a different kind of self-centeredness, it's pharisaism, and there is anger, anxiety, prejudice, bigotry, condescension.

-Nung sinabi ni Dr. Jekyl sa sarili niya, "I'm gonna rid of Edward Hyde, without that nasty potion, magiging sobrang mabuti ko..not realizing that it is only another way for him to become Edward Hyde.

-remember the parable of the prodigal son? Prodigal sons actually..both of these sons of the father, doesn't love their father..they just want the benefits that they can get from their father, but they don't want their father at all.

-I am following God, giving my resources faithfully, gave my life to full time ministry..then God has to bless me. Parang may utang na loob na ang Diyos sayo ngayon.

-So pwede palang gumagawa tayo ng mabuti with wrong motives and intentions..you may be doing good to gain self-respect, so that you can look at yourself in the mirror, so God will answer your prayers, he will save you from hell, he will take you to the new heavens and the new earth..you are doing good for your own sake.

-So ginagawa pala natin yung sinasabi ni Paul na hindi natin kayang gawin, every people, through will power, most Christians by trying really hard to be totally surrendered..

-hindi ba natin narerelize bakit may mga times, na grabe pa ang hilak nato..we are recommitting we are rededicating our lives to God..unya pag uli mo gikan simbahan, magyawyaw na pud ka sa inyong balay? makahimo na pud kang di maayo? Makapagisip na pud kang dili maayo?

-Si Jonathan Edwards nagsulat ng book ang title "The Nature of True Virtue" lisod kaayo basahon, pero ito yung isa sa message nya, "there is two ways to do something, you can do as a means to an end or an end to itself.

-Nung nasa Shekinah ako, dami namin pinagaaralan ng classical artist and composers, mga musical giants..hindi man ako nasanay sa mga ganung klase ng tugtugan, kasi mga rock man, heavy metal, reggae akong mga gusto, so kailangan naming maminaw sa mga classical music and magpractice ng mga pyesa..

-in short, tiisin mo makinig tsaka mag aral ng mga ganung klase ng music para mataas ang grado mo, para makahuman ka skwela, and eventually makagraduate, makapag full time ministry sa church..pero all through out sa years na pagstudy, it grew on me, yung classical music, mga hymns and style ng music na hindi ko nakasanayan, unti-unti kong minahal.." i fell in love with classical music" so dumating na yung punto, hanggang ngayon, na na-aappreciate ko na yung classical music not just to pass or as an obligation sa school but for the music itself. Sarap pakinggan, nawawala yung stress ko..it gives me peace of mind..i listen to it because now I love it...at mas matindi pa sa lahat ng ito, sa bible school ko natutunan that you should do everything you do because of your love for the Lord"

-Ngayon sabi ni Jonathan Edwards may dalawang paraan to obey the law of God. Listen carefully, una, you are doing it for your sake, you are doing it to get self-respect, para maganda ang image mo sa iba sa mga tao sa paligid mo, so that you can look at yourself in the mirror. You are doing it so God will favor you, so God will take you to heaven, so God must answer your prayers.

-pwede pala nating gawin ang isang bagay for the sake na sundin at gawin lang natin, out of a sense of responsibility..

-the other approach is to do it for God's sake..for the joy and happiness of following the Lord. Not to get favor, but to please Him, to thank Him..Just because He is good in and of Himself..

-hindi yung, Lord mabuti akong tao, no choice ka but to bless me. Provide for me..

-Pwedeng ginagawa natin yung mga good works natin to get "things from God", health, favor, provision..or pwedeng ginagawa natin yung mga ginagawa natin just to get God Himself. Just to please Him, just to resemble Him. Ang tawag ni Jonathan Edwards doon, yung una, common morality, and yung isa true virtue.

-In common morality ang ginagawa mo, you are using God, and you are using your morality in order to control your life. So now, parang walang ibang pwedeng gawin si Lord but to treat you well, in contrary naman sa True Virtue, you are doing it just for the joy of it, you are following the Lord because you just love Him, for the goodness of it, for the greatness of knowing God and resembling God.

-the vast majority of people is doing good because of fear and pride, hindi ako magsisinungaling? bakit? kasi takot mahuli..takot masira ang image nila... it's not the same thing just for doing it fotr the joy, of walking with integrity before God..you know that the Lord sees your heart, all should be because of sheer grace, and what you do is a response to that grace. Yung obedience natin hindi pilit, what do i mean by that..we will obey God, dahil mahal natin siya, not because you are being told. Your devotionals, you will do it on your own accord, not because someone is pushing you to do it.

Nevertheless, in the very heart of our moral life, you are actually nurturing evil, you are being good and being generous and being truthful out of fear and pride, out of self-centeredness. You may have been raised all of your life to tell the truth out of fear and pride, you may have been raised all of your life to do this and that, be generous out of fear and pride, but at some point, something will come into your life, some kind of stress, something bad will happen and you will find yourself lying, doing immoral acts..tapos tatanungin mo sarili mo "teka, wa ko kasabot..bakit ganito? I was not raised like that, and Jonathan Edwards says, "yes you were" you just didn't know you where. Unless you understand the gospel of sheer grace, unless your relationship with God is of absolute grace..there is a difference between a "restrained heart and a changed heart"

-There was once a gardener who grew an enormous carrot, dinala niya sa hari and he said "my king this is the best carrot i have grown and ever will grow and I want to give it to you as a token of my love, respect and adoration to you"

-the king was touched, he discerned the man's heart at sinabi niya sa gardener..I can see through your heart, you are a faithful steward, may 100 hectares ako na lupain na katabi ng property mo, I will give it yo you freely as a gift so you can garden it"

-tuwang tuwa yung gardener na umalis, but then there was a nobleman at the king's court na nakikinig sa usapan nila..at nagisip isip na siya..hmm..kung makakakuha ako ng 100 hectares out of a carrot...

-so kinabukasan nagdala siya ng isang napakagandang kabayo, and presented it to the king..sabi niya "my king, i breed horses and this is the best horse that i have bred and ever will be bred i will give it to you as a sign of my love and adoration.."

-but the king perceived what is in his heart and just took the horse and said thank you..ngayon yung nobleman was perplexed, tinawag nya yung hari..my Lord, i don't understand.. "the king replied, I know your perplexity, the gardener was giving me the carrot, but you are giving yourself a horse"

-Talaga bang ginagamit ka ng Diyos? O ikaw ang gumagamit sa Kaniya?

-Sinusunod mo ba ang Diyos dahil sa pagmamahal mo sa Kaniya o dahil sa mga bagay at benepisyo na makukuha mo sa Kaniya?

-unless you understand the gospel of radical grace that you are absolutely helpless, you are absolutely lost, that you deserve to go to hell, and you should have no complaints. But by infirite cost of His Son and by sheer grace God has saved you, and now your OBEDIENCE should be completely framed by that. Why do I love classical music now? because for me it's just beautiful, hindi na siya useful sa akin ngayon kasi graduate naman ako, but I love listening to it because I love it. Why do we please God? Because we can see His beauty! And if that begins to well up in your heart, and you start to live a good life, on the basis of that..yun ang totoong makakapagpabago sa atin.

-Otherwise, you are being generous but you are giving your money to yourself. You are giving your tithes and offerings kasi you are expecting something in return.

-You are feeding the hungry but you are feeding yourself

-You are clothing the naked but you are clothing yourself.

-Pwedeng tumutulong ka sa mga tao gamit ang social media, to get more views and to get money out of the content.

3. What is the solution? How can the Gospel change us?

-May sinabi si Paul sa beginning about the fact that we died to the law to be married to another? Isa sa mga naintindihan ko nung nakapasok ako sa buhay may asawa, I have come to realize that your spouse holds your self image in her hands. Sa ating may mga asawa, parang complicated, when everybody in the world is telling you that you are great and your spouse is telling you the very opposite, that you are the worst person in the world, hindi madaling isipin na ikaw nga ang pinaka worst person in the world. Sa kabaliktaran naman if the world is criticizing you but your spouse says "you're great"…hindi na importante sayo kung anong sasabihin ng mundo.

-Kasi narealize ko over the years, na si Elle mayroon siyang ability to really program my self-appreciation and the way i view myself. I believe hindi lang si Elle but kung sino man yung spouse natin, our life partner, they hold our self-value in their hands.

-Ngayon sabi ni Paul, is the law sin? No? Should we obey the law, of course we have to obey the law.

-We have to obey the law with all our might, but we cannot be "married to the law" he says.

-Hindi natin pwedeng tignan yung law as our spouse, you cannot look at the law at sabihin natin sa ating mga sarili na "kung masasatisfy ko lang siya, then I know I am a pretty good person."

-We have to be married with JESUS.

-Sabi ni Paul, you have been married to the law, but now you have to be married to Jesus.

-Kung nakasal ka na sa iba, then you want to be married to someone else, paano yun magiging posible? Not to many things, but one of the things is "death"

-except in this case it is Jesus' death

-balik tayo sa Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde as closing, nung patapos na yung story..napakalungkot nung nangyari..the last time na nagtransform si Dr. Jekyl as Mr. Hyde, hindi na siya makatransform balik sa original self nya.

-So si Mr. Hyde man yung pumapatay, hinahanap siya ng mga pulis pero hindi siya makita kay si Dr. Jekyl pa man siya, so nung last tranformation nya, hindi niya na maitago yung hideousness nya, yung kasamaan niya..kumakatok na yung mga pulis sa pinto, anong ginawa niya? pinatay nya sarili niya.

-Sabi ng bible, when 
Jesus Christ came to earth, He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,
nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
He was despised and rejected by mankind,
a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.
Like one from whom people hide their faces
he was despised.. But he was pierced for our transgressions,
he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
and by his wounds we are healed.

-This is straight out of Isaiah 53, look..when the police came for the hideous one, they got Jesus, not you. Jesus took upon Himself our hideousness, tayo yung deserving to be taken away, to be tried and killed.

-Christ came for our place, He was beautiful, he became hideous, He was perfect but then he took the place of the sinner.

-2 Corinthians 5:21, God made Him sin who knew no sin so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

-Only when you are melted by the beauty of Christ and what He did for you, that will turn you into a true generous giver, sa 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 hindi sinasabi ni Paul na dapat kayong maging mapagbigay kasi yung mga tao sa paligid nyo mahirap and you are rich.

-Ang sinasabi niya is that we know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ who though he was rich became poor for us..

in His poverty you might become rich and in his hideousness and disfigurement you can become beautiful in the eyes of God. Now it is only the affirmation of who you are in Christ is that matters and that changes our hearts..you have to take the gospel deeper in your hearts, not just try harder..but because in Christ it is finished. Let's pray.
