Lord's Day Preaching Assurance of Salvation John 10:27-29

# 1) INTRODUCTION

Mayroon pa bang isang bagay na napakasarap na maintindihan at malaman besides you being saved? If there is, yun yung katotohanan na when we are saved, we are eternally saved. 

-When we here this scriptural truth, maraming mga tao ang hindi pa handa na tanggapin ang katotohanang ito, kahit sa mga kasimbahanan, however, kung nanamnamin at pagaaralan natin ng mabuti ang salita ng ating Panginoon, ang bibliya..we cannot deny this fact. Even in the early church.

a) The only thing more wonderful than knowing you can be saved is being certain that you’re saved and knowing that once you’re saved, you can never lose your salvation. How can we know that in Christ our salvation is secure?

b) John 10:27-29 “My sheep hear my voice and I know them, they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.

c) Eternal security of the believer is not incidental but fundamental. It is not transactional but covenantal in nature.

i) Knowing that we are eternally secure is necessary for our spiritual health.

(1) Just as it is necessary for a child’s emotional strength to know that he is part of a family, so it is in the spiritual world. Ano kayang magiging kalagayan ng isang bata kung wala siyang security sa kaniyang pamilya? Into his/her day to day living? If you are a good boy today, you are a member of the family, kung bukas magpabadlong ka, hindi ka na member ng pamilya..one time you are loved by the Father, one minute hindi ka nanaman Niya mahal, on and off..magiging neurotic ang isang taong ganito ang standing..

Saan ba talaga tayong mga believers kumukuha ng emotional stability natin?

(a) Those who don’t know that they are saved and secure do not have the emotional stability that a child of God ought to have.

ii) It’s important to know that we’re eternally secure if we are going to be productive, fruit-bearing Christians.

(1) When we know that our future is secure, we can concentrate on the present. 

Noong 1937 naitatag yung Golden Gate bridge, noong panahon na yun eto yung longest suspension bridge. At yung mga trabahador doon takot na mahulog sila, at alam niyo ba na yung takot na yun, that very fear seems to be the cause and the reason bakit sila nahuhulog from that structure. 77 Million dollars ang halaga nitong bridge construction na ito at doon sa unang segment ng bridge hindi sila nakagawa ng safety net na magsasalba sa mga workers, at dahil doon alam nyo ba na 23 workers ang nahulog sa first section nung bridge, lahat sila namamatay pag nahuhulog sila sa tubig..so ang ginawa nilang solusyon doon sa sunod na section ng tulay, gumastos sila ng mahigit 100 thousand dollars para gumawa ng safety net..nung nakagawa sila ng safety net, may mga nahulog pa din. 10 workers nalang ang nahulog at lahat sila buhay dahil sa safety net..pero dahil doon sa safety net na yun yung trabaho nila naging 25% na mas mabilis kaysa nung wala pa yung net. Nakakapag concentrate sila safety trabaho nila kasi wala silang kaba, wala silang takot. 

-Ganun din tayong mga anak sa Ginoo, pag alam natin kung saan tayo papunta, na secured yung future natin, we can concentrate in the present.

iii) It is important to know that we are eternally secure in that it helps us in evangelism and soul winning.

(1) Some people never get saved because they are afraid that they won’t be able to hold out. 

-When I share the gospel sa plaza, madalas ng mga nakakausap ko, alam nyo kung anong fear nila? They fear that they will not hold up, na hindi nila  mamamaintain yung standing nila sa Diyos, na anytime pwede silang makagawa ng mali at mawala.. 

(a) They fear making a false start and falling away.

d) The God who saves us is the God who secures us. He is the God that keeps us. Ngayong umagang ito, wala akong pakialam sa kung anong sasabihin ng ibang mga tao, I wanted to proclaim to you this wonderful truth that the God who saved me, can also save you. And not just save you but keep you secured in His hands.

-Ano nga ba ibig sabihin na maging eternally secure tayo as a believer? Una sa lahat alamin muna natin ano nga ba ibig sabihin ng isang believer.

e) What does it mean to be a believer?

i) A believer is not someone who just have head knowledge.

ii) This is not someone who just joins a church, is baptized, gives money and does religious things.

(1) These things are well and good, but these things cannot save.

iii) A believer is a person who has placed his trust and faith in Christ as his/her Savior.

(1) A believer has become a partaker of the divine nature.

(a) A believer has been twice-born; he has received the new birth.

(2) This person can never again be a lost soul. 

-From this point malamang mayroong objection na mangagaling sa inyo, teka muna pastor..may mga kilala ako who once were saved and now no longer saved, may mga barkada ako na kasama ko sa simbahan dati, sa buluhaton ngayon wala na sila. We should be very careful when we say that..

iv) There are people whom we may think were saved who were never truly saved. 

(1) Matthew 7:22-23 Jesus was talking about the judgment then sabi Niya, many will say to me Lord, Lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and done many wonderful works, and Jesus said to them, depart from me you workers of iniquity, I NEVER knew you.

(a) Jesus did not say, “I once knew you, and you lost it.”

(b) Jesus said, “I never knew you.”

v) A believer is not someone who professed to be religious and then turned away.

(1) A believer is someone who has truly placed his trust in the Lord Jesus.

(2) John 10:27-29 My sheep hear my voice and I KNOW them and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. 

Pastor paano itong mga taong ito..

(3) If a person joins a church, gets baptized, lives for God for a while, then goes away and stays away, then they were never saved. Yes, if they go away and stay away, they were never saved.

(a) 1 John 2:19 “They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they have been of us they would know doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

(i) The reason they fell away was because they were never truly saved.

(b) The faith that fizzles before the finish had a flaw from the first. People who made a false start and then fall away were not saved.

(c) They didn’t lose their salvation; they never had it.

(4) Judas never lost his salvation; he was never saved.

(a) Jesus knew from the beginning that Judas did not believe in Him. 

(i) John 6:70-71 “Jesus answered them, “Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?” Now He was speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him.”

f) When speaking of eternal security, we are not talking about eternal security for those who have never been saved, but for those who have a personal, vital relationship with God through Christ.

g) The rest of today’s message will give reasons why and how you can know that you are eternally secure. 

-Here are 8 reasons starting with letter P that you are eternally secure in Christ Jesus.

1) PROMISE

a) God has promised us eternal security.

b) Romans 8:38-39 

-Ito yung sinasabi ni Apostle Paul, where he is totally convinced and persuaded.. “For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

i) The word “persuaded” means that he has a deep conviction.

ii) Paul gives a list of ten mighty opponents that cannot separate us from the love of God: Death cannot do it, if you as a believer you are in Christ, life itself..

(1) Angels cannot do it, which includes good and bad angels.

(a) Satan is a fallen angel.

(2) “Principalities” means that kingdoms cannot do it.

(3) “Powers” means that authorities cannot do it.

(4) “Things present” means that anything that happens in the world today cannot do it. Kahit na anong mga sakit, covid, mpox..kahit na anong persecution and tribulation from this earth..

(5) “Things to come” means that anything that may ever be created or come into being cannot do it.

(6) “Heights” means anything in Heaven above.

(7) “Depths” means anything in Hell beneath.

(8) “Any other creature” covers all the bases.

iii) There is nothing that can separate us from the love of God.

2) PERSEVERANCE

a) God will complete what He has begun.

b) Philippians 1:6 again in this passage, Paul is confident with this truth, “being confident of this very thing, that He who has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

i) When we get saved, who began the good work in you? Is it you or God? it is God (not us) who begins the good work in us. Why do you love God now as a believer? Because He first loved you.

ii) 1 John 4:19

c) The Holy Spirit is the agent of the new birth.

i) He is the convicter.

(1) He is the one who convicts us of sin.

(2) He is the one who shows us that we are sinners who need to be saved.

ii) He is the converter.

(1) He is the one who opens our eyes.

(2) He is the one who helps us understand the Gospel. Nasabtan at naintindihan mo ang katotohanan ng Gospel hindi dahil mas may sense ka sa ibang tao? Hindi dahil mas mabuti ka sa ibang tao, hindi dahil mas magaling ka kaysa sa ibang tao, hindi dahikl mas matalino ka sa ibang tao..but because the Holy Spirit regenerated your heart and opened your eyes to see Christ and His beauty. -Why? Because in your fallenness, hinding hindi mo pipiliin ang Diyos. For by grace you have been saved through faith, not of your own works so that no one may boast.

(3) He is the one who puts faith in our hearts and helps us receive the Lord Jesus Christ.

iii) He is the completer. Siya na nagsimula ng mabuting gawa sayo, the convicter and the converter will perform it until the day of Christ. 

-Lahat tayo in any point of our lives nakaranas tayo na mayroon tayong isang bagay na sinimulan tapos hindi natin natapos. Hindi ang Diyos..

(1) Philippians 1:6 “For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.”

-Naaalala ko yung kwento nung bata ako, mayroon daw nagsisiga-sigaan na tatay, sabi niya sa anak niya, na may listahan siya ng mga taong takot sa kaniya at kayang-kaya niyang gulpihin..eh yung anak niya may kalaro ding bata, tapos yung tatay nung batang yun, number one sa listahan nung mga taong kaya niyang patumbahin..nagsumbong ngayon yung anak doon sa papa niya at pumunta yung papa doon sa papa na naglista.. Sabi niya “balita ko may listahan ka ng mga taong kaya mo patumbahin at gulpihin ha”, andito ako..unya malaki ang katawan tadtad ng tattoo..dating nangulungan, ngayon ano gagawin mo? Sabi nung tatay na mayroon listahan, eh di buburahin ko yung pangalan mo dito.. 

-alam nyo napakasaya ko kasi yung Diyos natin doesn’t have an eraser in His hands at nag eerase ng mga pangalan sa listahan Niya. I am glad that God does not start something that He is not able to finish. 

That the job was not too big for Him.

(2) God has never started anything that He can’t finish.

(3) If any child of God, any of God’s elect were to perish, then that would mean that God the Father is defeated in His purpose.

(a) It would mean that God the Son is disappointed that His blood has no saving efficacy to keep. In the God-head in eternity past, even before the foundations of the world, God has purchased and acquired a people by His blood.

If anyone of God’s elect were to perish, anong ibig sabihin nun? Ibig sabihin nun, ineffective ang sakripisyo ni Kristo sa krus, ibig sabihin nun walay pulos ang pagdanak ng dugo ni Kristo sa krus. 

(b) It would mean that God the Holy Spirit is disgraced because He’s not able to complete that which He began.

d) It’s not the saints who persevere; it is the God of glory who is able to complete that which He has begun.

3) PREDESTINATION

a) Romans 8:29-30 “Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers; and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified.” 

-We all must be humble enough to believe what the bible says, not what we want to bible to say. The Bible says that God foreknew certain individuals and when God foreknows them then He predestines them.

i) “Predestinate” means that your destiny is already predetermined.

(1) You cannot be more sure than predestined. If you are predestined to be in heaven, then you will be in heaven. God said that you are predestined to be like the Lord Jesus Christ.

ii) In these verses, God gives us a chain with five golden links:

(1) Foreknowledge

(2) Predestination

(3) Calling

(4) Justification

(5) Glorification

iii) If you are a child of God, then God already sees you glorified. He already sees you in heaven.

(1) This passage in Romans does not say that He “will” glorify, but that you are already glorified.

b) Our salvation did not begin with us.

i) It began before the world was created.

(1) God saw us before He ever created this world, and He saw us glorified.

c) God sees the past, present and future all at one time.

i) God sees us now already in Heaven.

d) God sees us predestined to be like Jesus.

i) How could we ever lose our salvation if we are already predestined to be like Him?

e) What is settled in eternity cannot be undone in time.

f) What has been decreed by Heaven cannot be annulled by Hell.

g) Romans 11:29 “for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.”

i) God never changes His mind. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

(1) God foreknew, He called, and He predetermined that we would be like the Lord Jesus Christ.

4) PERFECTION

a) Hebrews 10:14, napakagandang bersikulo “For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified.”

i) That one offering is the precious blood of Jesus poured out on Calvary’s cross.

(1) That one offering makes us perfect forever.

b) When we get saved, we don’t just get a fresh start.

i) God doesn’t make the down payment and then leave it up to us to make the monthly installments. 

-Marami sa ating mga believers see it like that, na binibigyan tayo ng “fresh start” ng Panginoon, na pinapatawad Niya yung mga nagawa natin in the past, as if He is making a downpayment, then we should keep on paying monthly installments, trying to maintain our good credit standing and that is the reason why we will get to heaven.

(1) Kapatid Jesus pait it all! He paid it all the way through. For by one offering He has perfected them that are sanctified.

ii) We are made perfect forever in God’s sight.

(1) We didn’t get a fresh start; we got a new nature.

c) Nowhere in the Bible can we find anyone who was ever saved twice.

i) It is impossible to be saved twice.

(1) In order to be saved twice, Jesus would have to die twice.

(2) Jesus is not going back to the cross.

(a) For by one offering, we are perfected forever.

(i) Hebrews 10:14

d) In our flesh, we are not perfect. What if we got saved and we sin again?

-It does not mean that we have the license to sin when we are in Christ. Iyan ang isang pinakamalaking kasinungalingan ng kalaban. The moment that we are in Christ we are being transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Mayroon tayong pagbabago, when we sin we have this godly sorrow and lamenting. 

-When you are in Christ you are being sanctified by the Holy Spirit, your salvation and right standing with God is no longer dependent on you and what you can do. It is already about who Christ is and what He has done for you.

-Kapatid kung hawak mo ang kaluwasan mo, kung nasa iyong mga kamay at kapasidad ang pundasyon ng salvation mo, you will lose it right away, why? You are a justified sinner but you are still alive, alive in this world of sin..and is still sinning.

i) We can disobey God, and He will discipline us if we do.

(1) Hebrews 12:6 “For those whom the Lord loves He disciplines, And He flogs every son whom He receives.””

e) Romans 4:5-6 “But to the one who does not work, but believes upon Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:”

-maniniwala ka lang na pwedeng mawala sayo ang kaligtasan that was purchased for you by Christ if you believe that your good works will not be enough, hanggang anong level ng kabutihan, ng righteousness ang kailangan mong ma achieve for you to keep your salvation?

i) We are not saved by doing good works. On the cross of Christ there was a great exchange, ang tawag sa theology nito is the doctrine of imputation.

ii) “Impute” means to put on your account.

(1) God imputes, or puts, righteousness on our account. Our sins were imputed to Christ. Now God treats Christ as if He lived our sinful lives and He treats us as if we lived Christ’s perfect life.

(a) Not one thing did we do in order to get saved.

f) Romans 4:7 ““Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.” We are forgiven in Christ!

i) Not only does God forgive our sins, but He won’t bring them up again. Our sins were cast into the sea of God’s forgetfulness, hindi natin katulad ang Diyos, na hindi nakakalimot sayo mga kasalanan ng kapwa natin sa atin.

(1) They are gone.

(2) Because we confessed them, God forgave them.

g) Romans 4:8 ““Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.”” (Will not impute sin)

i) One-half of one sin would send us to Hell forever.

ii) Blessed are we to whom God will not impute sin. For by one offering He had perfected forever..

5) POSITION

a) We are already positioned in the Lord Jesus Christ. In our union with Christ positionally we are in Him.

b) 2 Corinthians 5:17

i) The old creation is Adam and his children.

ii) The new creation is Jesus and His children.

c) Everybody is either in Adam (the old creation) or in Christ (the new creation). [](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm)

Ephesians 2:6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,

i) As Christians, we are in the Lord Jesus Christ.

(1) What pertains to Jesus pertains to us.

(a) We lose our relationship with God the Father when Jesus Christ loses His because we are in Christ, and that will not happen.

(2) What is true of Christ is true of us because we are in Christ.

(a) We are not Christ, but we are in Christ.

(b) We are part of His body.

(i) Someone once asked, “What if you slip out of His hand?”

1. We can’t slip out; we are one of His fingers. We are abiding in Christ, we are in Him, we are united in Christ.

2. We are in the Lord Jesus.

d) This is illustrated by Noah’s ark.

i) Peter tells us that Noah’s ark is a picture of our salvation.

(1) 1 Peter 3:20-21

ii) Noah’s ark is a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

iii) God did not leave Noah and his family on the outside of the ark trying to hold on as best they could.

iv) God brought Noah and his family inside the ark.

(1) If any man be in Christ.

(a) 2 Corinthians 5:17

v) Genesis 7:1

(1) When God said, “Come in,” that meant that God was inside.

vi) Genesis 7:16

(1) God shut the door; it wasn’t Noah who shut the door.

(a) He shut the door to shut the water out and to shut Noah in.

(a) Ephesians 1:13 “In Him, you also, after listening to the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,”

(i) After we have believed, we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.

(3) God shut Noah in the ark with Himself.

vii) The only way that Noah could have gone down would have been for the ark to go down.

(1) The only way we can lose our salvation is for Jesus to go down because we are in Christ.

(2) Noah may have fallen down many times inside the ark, but he never fell out of the ark.

e) Some people think that they will only be secure when they get to Heaven.

i) Why would we be safe in Heaven if we’re not safe down here?

ii) The angels fell from Heaven.

(1) Security is not in a place; it is in a person, and His name is Jesus.

6) POSSESSION 

-we already have eternal life.

a) John 5:24 ““Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”

i) Everlasting life is not something we get when we die.

ii) Everlasting life is something we get when we believe.

b) If a person could lose their salvation, then what they had was not eternal life.

c) Eternal life is our possession right now.

i) Our eternal life began the moment we received the Lord Jesus.

d) 1 John 5:12

7) PRAYER

a) Jesus is interceding for us. He is our high priest.

i) He is praying for us.

b) John 17:9, 15.. “I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;” 

John 17:15“I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.” -my prayer is that you will keep them from evil.

i) “The world” in this passage means the unsaved.

ii) The Lord Jesus has never prayed a prayer that wasn’t answered because He always prays in the will of the Father.

iii) The Lord Jesus was not praying this prayer just for Peter, James and John.

(1) John 17:20 ““I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;” 

Kapatid, Christ is not just praying for His disciples but for you. For me, for all of us who believes in Him.

(a) The Lord Jesus has prayed for us that we’ll be kept.

(i) If we were not kept, then His prayer would not be answered.

c) Luke 22:31-32 

-Anong pagkakaparehas ni Hudas at ni pedro? Ano ang pagkakaiba nila?

i) Jesus prayed for Peter that his faith would not fail, and it did not fail.

(1) Though Peter stumbled, he was the mighty apostle of Pentecost.

d) Hebrews 7:25 “Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”

i) We have a Savior who is praying for us day by day, night by night, and year by year on the basis of His perfect sacrifice.

8) POWER

a) 1 Peter 1:3-5 “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in heaven for you, who are protected (who are KEPT) by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”

i) We are kept by the power of God.

b) John 10:27-28

i) There is no power strong enough to pry open the mighty hand of God and of the Lord Jesus.

(1) John 10:29

c) Some question whether or not Satan is able to pluck us out of God’s hand.

i) In John 10:29, the word “man” is italicized, meaning that it is supplied by the translator to make it read more smoothly.

(1) This passage literally says, “neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.”

ii) Luke 22:31-32

(1) Satan desired Peter.

iii) If Satan is able to pluck us out of the Father’s hand, then why hasn’t he done it?

(1) The only reason he hasn’t is because he can’t.

iv) If Satan were able to take us out of the Father’s hand and he hasn’t done it, then that would mean that Satan has been good to us.

(1) And we would be going to Heaven by the goodness of the devil.

d) Some have questioned whether or not we can take ourselves out of God’s hand.

i) John 10:27-28

(1) “They shall never perish” is in the middle voice, which literally means, “they shall never destroy themselves.” 

We are KEPT by the power of God.

10) CONCLUSION

a) Transfer your trust to yourself to Christ today. Recognize your sinfulness and repent.

i) He will save you and keep you.
