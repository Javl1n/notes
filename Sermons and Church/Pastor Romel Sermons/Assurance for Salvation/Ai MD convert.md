# Lord's Day Preaching: 
Assurance of Salvation John 10:27-29

---

## 1) INTRODUCTION

Is there anything more wonderful to understand and know besides being saved? If there is, it's the truth that when we are saved, we are **eternally saved**.

- When we hear this scriptural truth, many people are not ready to accept it, even in churches. However, if we carefully savor and study the word of our Lord, the Bible, we cannot deny this fact, even in the early church.

a) The only thing more wonderful than knowing you can be saved is being certain that you’re saved and knowing that once you’re saved, you can never lose your salvation. How can we know that in Christ our salvation is secure?

b) John 10:27-29 "My sheep hear my voice and I know them, they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand, my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand."

c) **Eternal security of the believer is not incidental but fundamental. It is not transactional but covenantal in nature.**

i) Knowing that we are eternally secure is necessary for our spiritual health.

(1) Just as it is necessary for a child’s emotional strength to know that he is part of a family, so it is in the spiritual world. What would be the condition of a child if they didn't have security in their family? In their day-to-day living? If you are a good boy today, you are a member of the family; if tomorrow you misbehave, you are no longer a member of the family... one time you are loved by the Father, one minute He doesn't love you anymore, on and off... such a person would become neurotic.

Where do we believers truly get our emotional stability?

(a) Those who don’t know that they are saved and secure do not have the emotional stability that a child of God ought to have.

ii) It’s important to know that we’re eternally secure if we are going to be productive, fruit-bearing Christians.

(1) When we know that our future is secure, we can concentrate on the present.

In 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge was built; at that time, it was the longest suspension bridge. The workers there were afraid of falling, and do you know that that very fear seemed to be the cause and the reason why they fell from that structure? This bridge construction cost 77 million dollars, and in the first segment of the bridge, they could not create a safety net to save the workers. Because of that, do you know that 23 workers fell in the first section of the bridge, all of them dying when they fell into the water? So, the solution they made for the next section of the bridge was to spend over 100 thousand dollars to make a safety net. When they made a safety net, some still fell. Only 10 workers fell, and all of them were alive because of the safety net. But because of that safety net, their work became 25% faster than when there was no net. They could concentrate on their work safely because they had no anxiety, no fear.

- It's the same for us, children of the Lord; if we know where we are going, that our future is secured, we can concentrate on the present.

iii) It is important to know that we are eternally secure in that it helps us in evangelism and soul winning.

(1) Some people never get saved because they are afraid that they won’t be able to hold out.

- When I share the gospel in the plaza, often the people I talk to, do you know what their fear is? They fear that they will not hold up, that they will not maintain their standing with God, that anytime they can do something wrong and lose it...

(a) They fear making a false start and falling away.

d) **The God who saves us is the God who secures us. He is the God that keeps us.** This morning, I don't care what other people say; I wanted to proclaim to you this wonderful truth that the God who saved me can also save you. And not just save you but keep you secured in His hands.

- What does it mean to be eternally secure as a believer? First of all, let's understand what a believer means.

e) What does it mean to be a believer?

i) A believer is not someone who just has head knowledge.

ii) This is not someone who just joins a church, is baptized, gives money, and does religious things.

(1) These things are well and good, but these things cannot save.

iii) A believer is a person who has placed his trust and faith in Christ as his/her Savior.

(1) A believer has become a partaker of the divine nature.

(a) A believer has been twice-born; he has received the new birth.

(2) This person can never again be a lost soul.

- From this point, an objection will probably come from you, "Wait a minute, pastor... I know people who once were saved and now are no longer saved. I have friends who were with me in church before, in ministry, and now they are no longer there." We should be very careful when we say that...

iv) There are people whom we may think were saved who were never truly saved.

(1) Matthew 7:22-23 Jesus was talking about the judgment, then He said, "Many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and cast out demons in Your name, and perform many miracles?' And then I will declare to them, 'I NEVER knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.'"

(a) Jesus did not say, “I once knew you, and you lost it.”

(b) Jesus said, “I never knew you.”

v) A believer is not someone who professed to be religious and then turned away.

(1) A believer is someone who has truly placed his trust in the Lord Jesus.

(2) John 10:27-29 "My sheep hear my voice and I KNOW them and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish."

Pastor, what about these people?

(3) If a person joins a church, gets baptized, lives for God for a while, then goes away and stays away, then they were never saved. Yes, if they go away and stay away, they were never saved.

(a) 1 John 2:19 "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."

(i) The reason they fell away was because they were never truly saved.

(b) The faith that fizzles before the finish had a flaw from the first. People who made a false start and then fall away were not saved.

(c) They didn’t lose their salvation; they never had it.

(4) Judas never lost his salvation; he was never saved.

(a) Jesus knew from the beginning that Judas did not believe in Him.

(i) John 6:70-71 "Jesus answered them, 'Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?' Now He was speaking of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him."

f) When speaking of eternal security, we are not talking about eternal security for those who have never been saved, but for those who have a personal, vital relationship with God through Christ.

g) The rest of today’s message will give reasons why and how you can know that you are eternally secure.

- Here are 8 reasons, starting with the letter 'P', that you are eternally secure in Christ Jesus.

---

## 1) PROMISE

a) God has promised us eternal security.

b) Romans 8:38-39

- This is what Apostle Paul says, where he is totally convinced and persuaded... "For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

i) The word “persuaded” means that he has a deep conviction.

ii) Paul gives a list of ten mighty opponents that cannot separate us from the love of God: Death cannot do it; if you as a believer you are in Christ, life itself...

(1) Angels cannot do it, which includes good and bad angels.

(a) Satan is a fallen angel.

(2) “Principalities” means that kingdoms cannot do it.

(3) “Powers” means that authorities cannot do it.

(4) “Things present” means that anything that happens in the world today cannot do it. No matter what sickness, COVID, MPox... no matter what persecution and tribulation from this earth...

(5) “Things to come” means that anything that may ever be created or come into being cannot do it.

(6) “Heights” means anything in Heaven above.

(7) “Depths” means anything in Hell beneath.

(8) “Any other creature” covers all the bases.

iii) There is nothing that can separate us from the love of God.

---

## 2) PERSEVERANCE

a) God will complete what He has begun.

b) Philippians 1:6 again in this passage, Paul is confident with this truth, "being confident of this very thing, that He who has began a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."

i) When we get saved, who began the good work in you? Is it you or God? It is God (not us) who begins the good work in us. Why do you love God now as a believer? Because He first loved you.

ii) 1 John 4:19

c) The Holy Spirit is the agent of the new birth.

i) He is the convicter.

(1) He is the one who convicts us of sin.

(2) He is the one who shows us that we are sinners who need to be saved.

ii) He is the converter.

(1) He is the one who opens our eyes.

(2) He is the one who helps us understand the Gospel. Did you comprehend and understand the truth of the Gospel not because you have more sense than others? Not because you are better than others, not because you are more capable than others, not because you are smarter than others... but because the Holy Spirit regenerated your heart and opened your eyes to see Christ and His beauty. - Why? Because in your fallenness, you would never choose God. For by grace you have been saved through faith, not of your own works so that no one may boast.

(3) He is the one who puts faith in our hearts and helps us receive the Lord Jesus Christ.

iii) He is the completer. He who began the good work in you, the convicter and the converter, will perform it until the day of Christ.

- All of us at some point in our lives have experienced starting something and not finishing it. Not God...

(1) Philippians 1:6 "For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."

- I remember a story when I was a child; there was a boastful father who told his son that he had a list of people he wasn't afraid of and could beat up. His son had a friend, and that child's father was number one on the list of people he could defeat. The son reported this to his father, and the father went to the father who made the list. He said, "I heard you have a list of people you can defeat and beat up," and here I am... big body, covered in tattoos... a former inmate, now what will you do? The father with the list said, "Well, I'll just erase your name from here..."
    
- You know, I am so happy because our God doesn’t have an eraser in His hands to erase names from His list. I am glad that God does not start something that He is not able to finish.
    

That the job was not too big for Him.

(2) God has never started anything that He can’t finish.

(3) If any child of God, any of God’s elect were to perish, then that would mean that God the Father is defeated in His purpose.

(a) It would mean that God the Son is disappointed that His blood has no saving efficacy to keep. In the God-head in eternity past, even before the foundations of the world, God has purchased and acquired a people by His blood.

If anyone of God’s elect were to perish, what would that mean? It would mean that Christ's sacrifice on the cross was ineffective, it would mean that the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross was useless.

(b) It would mean that God the Holy Spirit is disgraced because He’s not able to complete that which He began.

d) It’s not the saints who persevere; it is the God of glory who is able to complete that which He has begun.

---

## 3) PREDESTINATION

a) Romans 8:29-30 "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers; and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified."

- We all must be humble enough to believe what the Bible says, not what we want the Bible to say. The Bible says that God foreknew certain individuals, and when God foreknows them, then He predestines them.

i) “Predestinate” means that your destiny is already predetermined.

(1) You cannot be more sure than predestined. If you are predestined to be in heaven, then you will be in heaven. God said that you are predestined to be like the Lord Jesus Christ.

ii) In these verses, God gives us a chain with five golden links:

(1) Foreknowledge

(2) Predestination

(3) Calling

(4) Justification

(5) Glorification

iii) If you are a child of God, then God already sees you glorified. He already sees you in heaven.

(1) This passage in Romans does not say that He “will” glorify, but that you are already glorified.

b) Our salvation did not begin with us.

i) It began before the world was created.

(1) God saw us before He ever created this world, and He saw us glorified.

c) God sees the past, present and future all at one time.

i) God sees us now already in Heaven.

d) God sees us predestined to be like Jesus.

i) How could we ever lose our salvation if we are already predestined to be like Him?

e) What is settled in eternity cannot be undone in time.

f) What has been decreed by Heaven cannot be annulled by Hell.

g) Romans 11:29 "for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable."

i) God never changes His mind. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

(1) God foreknew, He called, and He predetermined that we would be like the Lord Jesus Christ.

---

## 4) PERFECTION

a) Hebrews 10:14, a very beautiful verse, "For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified."

i) That one offering is the precious blood of Jesus poured out on Calvary’s cross.

(1) That one offering makes us perfect forever.

b) When we get saved, we don’t just get a fresh start.

i) God doesn’t make the down payment and then leave it up to us to make the monthly installments.

- Many of us believers see it like that, that the Lord gives us a "fresh start," that He forgives our past deeds, as if He is making a down payment, then we should keep on paying monthly installments, trying to maintain our good credit standing and that is the reason why we will get to heaven.

(1) Brother/Sister, Jesus paid it all! He paid it all the way through. For by one offering He has perfected them that are sanctified.

ii) We are made perfect forever in God’s sight.

(1) We didn’t get a fresh start; we got a new nature.

c) Nowhere in the Bible can we find anyone who was ever saved twice.

i) It is impossible to be saved twice.

(1) In order to be saved twice, Jesus would have to die twice.

(2) Jesus is not going back to the cross.

(a) For by one offering, we are perfected forever.

(i) Hebrews 10:14

d) In our flesh, we are not perfect. What if we got saved and we sin again?

- It does not mean that we have the license to sin when we are in Christ. That is one of the enemy's biggest lies. The moment that we are in Christ, we are being transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. We have a change; when we sin, we have this godly sorrow and lamenting.
    
- When you are in Christ, you are being sanctified by the Holy Spirit; your salvation and right standing with God is no longer dependent on you and what you can do. It is already about who Christ is and what He has done for you.
    
- Brother/Sister, if you hold your salvation, if the foundation of your salvation is in your hands and capacity, you will lose it right away, why? You are a justified sinner, but you are still alive, alive in this world of sin... and are still sinning.
    

i) We can disobey God, and He will discipline us if we do.

(1) Hebrews 12:6 "For those whom the Lord loves He disciplines, And He flogs every son whom He receives."

e) Romans 4:5-6 "But to the one who does not work, but believes upon Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:"

- You will only believe that the salvation purchased for you by Christ can be lost if you believe that your good works will not be enough. To what level of goodness, of righteousness, do you need to achieve for you to keep your salvation?

i) We are not saved by doing good works. On the cross of Christ there was a great exchange; the theological term for this is the **doctrine of imputation**.

ii) “Impute” means to put on your account.

(1) God imputes, or puts, righteousness on our account. Our sins were imputed to Christ. Now God treats Christ as if He lived our sinful lives and He treats us as if we lived Christ’s perfect life.

(a) Not one thing did we do in order to get saved.

f) Romans 4:7 "“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.” We are forgiven in Christ!

i) Not only does God forgive our sins, but He won’t bring them up again. Our sins were cast into the sea of God’s forgetfulness; God is not like us, who do not forget the sins of our neighbors against us.

(1) They are gone.

(2) Because we confessed them, God forgave them.

g) Romans 4:8 "“Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.”" (Will not impute sin)

i) One-half of one sin would send us to Hell forever.

ii) Blessed are we to whom God will not impute sin. For by one offering He had perfected forever...

---

## 5) POSITION

a) We are already positioned in the Lord Jesus Christ. In our union with Christ, positionally, we are in Him.

b) 2 Corinthians 5:17

i) The old creation is Adam and his children.

ii) The new creation is Jesus and His children.

c) Everybody is either in Adam (the old creation) or in Christ (the new creation).

[Ephesians 2:6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm)

i) As Christians, we are in the Lord Jesus Christ.

(1) What pertains to Jesus pertains to us.

(a) We lose our relationship with God the Father when Jesus Christ loses His because we are in Christ, and that will not happen.

(2) What is true of Christ is true of us because we are in Christ.

(a) We are not Christ, but we are in Christ.

(b) We are part of His body.

(i) Someone once asked, “What if you slip out of His hand?”

1. We can’t slip out; we are one of His fingers. We are abiding in Christ, we are in Him, we are united in Christ.
    
2. We are in the Lord Jesus.
    

d) This is illustrated by Noah’s ark.

i) Peter tells us that Noah’s ark is a picture of our salvation.

(1) 1 Peter 3:20-21

ii) Noah’s ark is a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

iii) God did not leave Noah and his family on the outside of the ark trying to hold on as best they could.

iv) God brought Noah and his family inside the ark.

(1) If any man be in Christ.

(a) 2 Corinthians 5:17

v) Genesis 7:1

(1) When God said, “Come in,” that meant that God was inside.

vi) Genesis 7:16

(1) God shut the door; it wasn’t Noah who shut the door.

(a) He shut the door to shut the water out and to shut Noah in.

(a) Ephesians 1:13 "In Him, you also, after listening to the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,"

(i) After we have believed, we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.

(3) God shut Noah in the ark with Himself.

vii) The only way that Noah could have gone down would have been for the ark to go down.

(1) The only way we can lose our salvation is for Jesus to go down because we are in Christ.

(2) Noah may have fallen down many times inside the ark, but he never fell out of the ark.

e) Some people think that they will only be secure when they get to Heaven.

i) Why would we be safe in Heaven if we’re not safe down here?

ii) The angels fell from Heaven.

(1) Security is not in a place; it is in a person, and His name is Jesus.

---

## 6) POSSESSION

- We already have eternal life.

a) John 5:24 "“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”"

i) Everlasting life is not something we get when we die.

ii) Everlasting life is something we get when we believe.

b) If a person could lose their salvation, then what they had was not eternal life.

c) Eternal life is our possession right now.

i) Our eternal life began the moment we received the Lord Jesus.

d) 1 John 5:12

---

## 7) PRAYER

a) Jesus is interceding for us. He is our high priest.

i) He is praying for us.

b) John 17:9, 15... "I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the world but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;"

John 17:15 "I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one." - My prayer is that you will keep them from evil.

i) “The world” in this passage means the unsaved.

ii) The Lord Jesus has never prayed a prayer that wasn’t answered because He always prays in the will of the Father.

iii) The Lord Jesus was not praying this prayer just for Peter, James, and John.

(1) John 17:20 "“I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word;”"

Brother/Sister, Christ is not just praying for His disciples but for you. For me, for all of us who believe in Him.

(a) The Lord Jesus has prayed for us that we’ll be kept.

(i) If we were not kept, then His prayer would not be answered.

c) Luke 22:31-32

- What is the similarity between Judas and Peter? What is their difference?

i) Jesus prayed for Peter that his faith would not fail, and it did not fail.

(1) Though Peter stumbled, he was the mighty apostle of Pentecost.

d) Hebrews 7:25 "Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."

i) We have a Savior who is praying for us day by day, night by night, and year by year on the basis of His perfect sacrifice.

---

## 8) POWER

a) 1 Peter 1:3-5 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in heaven for you, who are protected (who are KEPT) by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

i) We are kept by the power of God.

b) John 10:27-28

i) There is no power strong enough to pry open the mighty hand of God and of the Lord Jesus.

(1) John 10:29

c) Some question whether or not Satan is able to pluck us out of God’s hand.

i) In John 10:29, the word “man” is italicized, meaning that it is supplied by the translator to make it read more smoothly.

(1) This passage literally says, “neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.”

ii) Luke 22:31-32

(1) Satan desired Peter.

iii) If Satan is able to pluck us out of the Father’s hand, then why hasn’t he done it?

(1) The only reason he hasn’t is because he can’t.

iv) If Satan were able to take us out of the Father’s hand and he hasn’t done it, then that would mean that Satan has been good to us.

(1) And we would be going to Heaven by the goodness of the devil.

d) Some have questioned whether or not we can take ourselves out of God’s hand.

i) John 10:27-28

(1) “They shall never perish” is in the middle voice, which literally means, “they shall never destroy themselves.”

We are KEPT by the power of God.

---

## 10) CONCLUSION

a) Transfer your trust from yourself to Christ today. Recognize your sinfulness and repent.

i) He will save you and keep you.
