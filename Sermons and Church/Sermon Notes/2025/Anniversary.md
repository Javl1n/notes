Matthew 16:13-18
# the church
That will be found standing still on a solid foundation through the years

## What is a church?
- Not a building but an individual or a group of people who
	1. Believe in jesus and his redemptive work on the cross
	2. Admits their sins and repent
	3. Receive jesus as a savior and lord
	4. Actively obey god's work
- Ecclesia - the called out ones
- Called out from 
	- being a dinner to saint
	- Darkness to light
	- Condemnation to salvation
	- World to the word
- Transfer of loyalty, a change of activities from worldly to godly

Regeneration 
- Jesus as a savior
- Inward state of the church
Obeying
- Jesus as lord
- outward outflow of the inward reality
## How will the church remain standing still?

### The church's foundation
1. Right faith
	- matthew 16:16-8
	- you are the messiah the son of the living God
	- this rock
		- refers to peter on the basis of his confession of faith that jesus is the messiah, the son of the living god
	- right faith is that
		- you believe in jesus and his redemptive work on the cross
		- you admit your sins and repent
		- you receive jesus into your heart as savior and Lord
		- actively obey God's word
2. Active obedience to god's word
	- standing still church
	- right faith in jesus and active obedience to him - the foundation on the church
