# Radical Love
## 3 Main Point
1. Undeserved Love - TRUTH
	- Unfaithfulness - idolatry
	- This love isn't earned;
	- it's a gift based on God's character
	- God loves us not because of who we are, but because who He is
	- you can love this person because you can love that person, then that's love
2. Costly Redemption - SACRIFICE
	- Restoring broken relationship requires **sacrifice**
	- Jesus paid for our redemption- His own Life
3. Restorative Discipline - RESTORATION
	- This isn't punishment for the sake of punishment, but a loving attempt to bring us back to Him
	- God's discipline is always intended to restore us to a right relationship with Him.
	- it's a pathway to healing and renewed commitment
## conclusion
Where have we been unfaithful in our own lives?

What idols have we allowed to take the place of God?

Are we willing to accept God's discipline and turn back to Him with all our hearts?


No matter undeserving a person is, how impossible they are to be loved, God is love, He will enable you to love that Person.

No matter how undeserving, Costly And Impossible, True love only comes to those who accept and believed the one "TRUE GOD"

God is Love
