# God's Righteous Judgement: The Law Written on Their Hearts

## The Basis of Judgement
**According to the Law**
Romans 2:12
- there are two people in this world
	- Jews
	- Gentiles
- God judges impartially not by possession of the law, but the obedience of it
- we are justified by the obedience of the Law
- God will also judge us according to the Light that we receive, light that points us to God
- two ways God revealed His Law to us
	- external creation
	- internal conscience
- we gentiles are not judged by the law, because it is not given to us, but we will be judged by the light that we have received
- we will all be judged through our Hearts, the light that we have received

## Hearing vs Doing the Law
**The Requirement og Righteousness**
Romans 2:13
- mere knowledge of the law is insufficient, obedience is required
- if we have heard the law, and we have come to Jesus Christ, the one who completed the Law, that is the way that we can be saved
- how can we follow the Law? **trusting in Christ**.
- when He looks at you, He looks at Christ
- we must Actively live out God's word, not merely listen to It (James 1:22)
- Move beyond passive listening to active doing of God's Word

## The Law written on Their Hearts 
**The Role of Conscience**
Romana 2:14-15
- Even without the Mosaic Law, The gentiles demonstrate moral awareness
- a child instinctively knowing right or wrong before being told
- Conscience serves as an internal witness, revealing God's moral Law
- because of the fall, we all deserve to end up in Hell.
- if you do not trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and what He has done on the Cross for you, You will not go to the Kingdom
- the Gentiles or non-jews are a Law to themselves
- Makes the Non-Christian inexcusable before the Lord Almighty God.
	- The Law is in our Hearts
	- God's moral law is in our conscience
- Listen to and cultivate a sensitive conscience guided by God's word.
## The Day of Judgement
**According to the Gospel**
Romans 2:16
- God's judgement is thorough, including even secret thoughts and motives.
- God will judge us accordingly through Christ.
- live transparently, preparing for the day of Judgement
