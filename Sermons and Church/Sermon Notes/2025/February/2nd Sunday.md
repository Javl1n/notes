## We have been given the freedom to fulfill the Greatest command to Love
**Galatians 5:13-15**
- you my brothers and sisters were called to be free, but do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh.
- God has given us the freedom to serve.

## We have been given the Spirit to walk with
**Galatians 5:16-18**
- Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
- Wala gikuha sa Diyos atong flesh. God didn't take our flesh
- we are still in this corruptible body, where it is dominated
