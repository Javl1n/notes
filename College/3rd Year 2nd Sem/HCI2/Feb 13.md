# History of Human-Computer Interactions

## Early Foundation
40s - 60s
- focuses on the origins of the HCI
- began on the WW2
- Start of morse code
- early computing systems were developed
- the punch card system
	- first method of human and computer interaction

## Emmergence of Graphical User Interface (GUI)
70s - 80s
- pioneer the **xerox parc (palo alto reasearch center)**
	- intruduces the windows Icon
	- develops or introduces the mouse

## Cognitive Revolution
80s - 90s
- Understanding of Human Thoughts or Processes (Psychology)
- in order to improve the usability of **HCI**
- UCD - user centered design
- each interface should match what people think or what people needs
- The Psychology of Everyday Things (1988) by Don Normans
	- focuses on the usability and intuitive design

## Ubiquitous Computing and Mobile HCI
1990s - 2000s
- Personal computers became common
- Internet added more Interactive User Interface
	- changed how human interact with computers
- Introduction of Mobile Devices and Touch screens

## Social and Emotional Aspect of HCI
2000 - 2010
- Focuses on Social interactions and Emotion
- Rise of Social Media
- change how we human interact in online world

## Ethical Consideration and Human Centered AI 
Present - Future
- Technology can now detect human emotion
- less privacy
- designing is easier because of AI

# Trends and Challenges in HCI Research
## Trends
- Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
	- researchers explore novel technology
	- HCI focuses on what is trending nowadays
- Natural User Interface (NUI)
	- Gesture Based Control
	- Voice recognition
- Human AI (Interaction)
	- Issues related to trust, transparency, and ethical implications of AI powered interfaces
	- investigates how user interact with artificial intellegent
- Wearable Technology
	- Smart Watch, Chips
- Accessibility and inclusive design
	- aims to create products that accommodate a wide range of users
- multi-modal interaction
	- touch, voice, gesture combined
- Ethical Consideration
	- ethical design practices and guidelines for responsible design choices
- Emotion and Affective Computing
	- involves developing systems that can recognize interpret and respond to users emotional states
## Challenges in HCI
- privacy and security
	- data more vulnerable because of the evolution of hci and ai
	- privacy and security challenges are continuous because evolution of technology is continuous 
- adapting to emerging technologies
	- adaptation is a must
	- very rapid
- cross cultural design
	- when designing, you should be diverse
	- not one point of view
	- multimodal
- user engagement and experience
	- engagement is difficult nowadays
- human centered ai design
- accessibility gaps
- inter disciplinary collaboration 

## HCI Assignment
HCI milestone
Discuss the impact on modern technology
- Early foundation until present and future
- Provide one significant event of hci development per stage
- Sa future part: forsee what will be the innovation of HCI in the near future
	- example ai, robot, etc

1. AI And Automation Are Omnipresent
2. Quantum Computing
