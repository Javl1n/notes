# What are the users' needs
- Functionality
- Usability
	- measurement of how easily can accomplish their goals
- Aesthetics
- Accessibility 
- Emotional Satisfaction
# Key challenges in Designing UX (User Experience)
## 1. Diverse user background and context
- Cultures differ
### Localization
- Adopt on the local culture
- adopt on the local language
- adopt to local religion
- know your main user
### Globalization
- if your work is applicable everywhere and for everybody
- all language
- All disabilities
- all religion
## 2. Misalignment between user needs and design inputs
- do not be biased when it comes to designing
- clarify who will be your target users

## 3. Lack of user research
- user experience should not be surface level
- understand who will be your main target users
### Five parts of UX design (Bottom-up)
Developed by Jessie James Garrett: 
#### strategy
- helps identify who you are designing for and why
#### scope
- Define what you will be designing
- what features and functionalities will help address the users' needs
#### structure
- How the product or solution works
- create a blueprint
	- how system works behind the screen
	- how user will interact in your system
#### skeleton
- laying out the first interface of the solution
- database
#### surface
- your users' interaction
- visible part of your system
## 4. Failure iterate and adapt
- if this, your system will get irrelevant
## 5. Role ambiguity
- you should know the difference between ux and graphic design
### 2 approaches to user research
#### 1. Attitudinal
- listen to what user says
#### 2.Behavioral
- observe what users do
#### User research help designers to:
1. Validate assumptions
	- real world insights
2. Uncover hidden needs
	- uncover what attitudinal cannot express
3. Prioritize features and functionality
	- deepen the preference of the users
	- put yourself in the shoes of your users
4. Test and validate design solutions
	- usability testing
	- let designers observe how users interact with the prototype or existing design
