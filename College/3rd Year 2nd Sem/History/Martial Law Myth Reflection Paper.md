# Debunking the Myth of Martial Law as the "Golden Age" of the Philippines

Some people today claim that the time of Martial Law under President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. was the “Golden Age” of the Philippines. They say the country was peaceful, the economy was growing, and that everything was better. But when we take a closer look at the truth, we learn that this is not really what happened.

Martial Law started in 1972 and lasted until 1981, but its effects were felt long after. Marcos said he declared Martial Law to stop crime and rebellion, but what really happened was that he took control of the government, silenced the media, and stayed in power longer than allowed. Many people were jailed, tortured, or even killed just for speaking out.

While it’s true that roads, buildings, and some other projects were built during this time, these were paid for with huge foreign loans. The country’s debt grew a lot—from about $2 billion in 1972 to more than $28 billion by 1986. This created problems for the economy, including high prices and fewer jobs. Many Filipinos became poorer, not richer.

Even worse, thousands of human rights abuses happened during Martial Law. People were arrested without proof, tortured, and some were never seen again. There was no freedom of speech, and the press was controlled by the government. These are not signs of a good or successful time—they are signs of a dictatorship.

As a student, I realize how important it is to know the real history of our country. We should not believe everything we see on social media or hear from others without checking the facts. Learning from the past helps us avoid making the same mistakes again.

In conclusion, Martial Law was not a golden age. It was a time of fear, injustice, and hardship for many Filipinos. We need to remember the truth and honor those who fought for freedom and democracy. Knowing history helps us build a better future for ourselves and our country.
