- Globalization relies on media as its main conduit for the spread of global culture and ideas

#### Jack Lule
> Could global trade have evolved without a flow of information on markets, prices, commodities, and more? Could religion, music, poetry, film, fiction, cuisine, and fashion develop as they have without the intermingling of media and cultures?

#### Marshall McLuhan
> The medium is the message
- He did NOT mean that ideas ("messages") are useless and do not affect people
- an attempt to draw attention to how media, as a form of technology, reshape societies.
	- Television is not a simple bearer of messages, it also shapes the social behavior of users and reorient family behavior

##### Television
- steered people from the dining table where they eat and tell stories to each other, to the living room where they silently munch on their food while watching primetime shows
- drawn people away from other meaningful activities such as playing games or reading books
##### Smart Phones
- allows users to keep in touch instantly with multiple people at the same time
##### Internet
- prior to the cellphone, there was no way what the other does all the time

#### McLuhan
- different media simultaneously extend and amputate human senses
- new media may expand the reach of communication, but they also dull the users' communicative capacities
##### Writing
- people wrote things down on parchment, exchanging stories was mainly done orally
- to be able to pass stories verbally from one person to another, storytellers had to have retentive memories
- papyrus started becoming more common in Egypt after the fourth century BCE, which increasingly meant that more people could write down their stories
- storytellers no longer had to rely completely on their memories
- this dulled the people's capacity to remember.

##### Cellphones
- they expand people's senses because they provide the capability to talk to more people instantaneously and simultaneously
- they also limit the senses because they make users easily distractible and more prone to multitasking

New media are neither inherently good nor bad

## The Global Village and Cultural Imperialism
### Global Village
- as more and more people sat down in front of their television sets and listened to the same stories, their perception of the world would contract.
- if tribal villages once sat in front of fires to listen to collective stories, the members of the new global village would sit in front of bright boxes in their living rooms.

### Cultural Imperialism
- assumed that global media had a tendency to homogenize culture
- people from all over the world would begin to watch, listen to, and read the same things.
- America's power had turned it into the world's cultural heavyweight
- media globalization coupled with American hegemony would create a  form of cultural imperialism whereby American values and culture would overwhelm all others
- scholars who decry cultural imperialism, however, have a top-down view of the media, since they are more concerned with the broad structures that determine media content

### Critiques of Cultural Imperialism
- media messages are not just made by producers, they are also consumed by audiences
- media scholars began to pay attention to the ways in which audiences understood and interpreted media messages.
