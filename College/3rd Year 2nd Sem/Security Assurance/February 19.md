# Types of Breaches
## Data Breach
A **data breach** is any security incident in which unauthorized parties access sensitive or confidential information, including personal data (Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, healthcare data) and corporate data (customer records, intellectual property, financial information).

## Security Breach
A security breach is when someone gains unauthorized access to sensitive information, systems, or networks. This can be done by exploiting weaknesses in security protocols.
### types of Security Breach
- Phishing
	- Social Engineering attacks that trick users into revealing sensitive information.
- Malware
	- Malicious software that steals data or disrupts operations
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attack
	- Flooding a network with fake requests to crash the system
- Zero-day attack
	- Exploiting a vulnerability in software or hardware before the company knows about it.

### Activities that cause security breach
- Weak and stolen credentials
- Backdoor and application vulnerabilities
- Malware
- Social engineering
- Too many permissions
- Ransomware
- Improper configuration and exposure via APIs
- DNS attacks
# Hackers
## Different of hackers and their roles
### Black Hat
A black hat hacker is someone who maliciously searches for and exploits vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks. often uses malware and other hacking techniques to do harm.

These stereotypical hackers might break laws as part of their hacking exploits, infiltrating victims' networks for monetary gain, stealing or destroying data, disrupting systems, conducting cyberespionage or just having fun.

### White Hat
A white hat hacker, also known as an ethical hacker, is a security specialist hired to find vulnerabilities in software, hardware and networks that black hats might find and target. Unlike black hats, white hats only hack networks when legally permitted to do so.

White hats disclose all vulnerabilities to their employers. White hats also disclose vulnerabilities to the vendors whose hardware or software is affected so they can patch other customers' systems. White hat hacking techniques include penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

### Gray Hats
A fusion of black and white, gray hats exploit security vulnerabilities without malicious intent, like white hats, but might use illegal methods to find flaws, like black hats. They might even release vulnerabilities to the public or sell details about them for a profit, like a black hat would. Gray hat hackers often hack without the target's permission or knowledge.

The gray hat description is also used to categorize hackers who might, at one stage in life, have broken the law in their hacking activities but have since become a more ethical, white hat hacker.

## Different tools of Hackers
### Remote Access Tools
A Remote Access Tool (RAT) is a program, which, once installed on a victim’s machine, allows remote administrative control. In a malicious context, they can provide the ability for an actor to upload and download files, execute commands, log keystrokes, and/or record a user’s screen.

#### JBiFrost
- primarily delivered through emails as an attachment, usually an invoice notice, request for quotation, remittance notice, shipment notification, payment notice or with a link to a file hosting service.

### Web Shells
- malicious scripts which are uploaded to a target host after an initial compromise and grant an actor remote access into a network. Once this access is established, web shells can facilitate lateral movement within a network.

#### China Chopper
- a well-documented and publicly available web shell that has seen widespread use since 2012.
- Capabilities include uploading and downloading files to and from the victim, execution of arbitrary commands, using operating system file-retrieval tools to download files to the target, and filesystem modification.

### Credential Stealers
- designed to allow a malicious actor to collect credentials of other users who are logged into a targeted machine, which can then be reused to give access to other machines on a network.

#### Mimikatz
- emerged as a common tool used by multiple actors to obtain credentials from networks
- typically being used once access has been gained to a host and the actor wishes to move throughout the internal network.
- Widespread use of this tool has been observed amongst organised crime and state-sponsored groups.

### Lateral Movement Tools
- allow an actor to move around a network after gaining initial access.

#### PowerShell Empire
- a tool commonly used by malicious actors, although it was designed as a legitimate penetration testing tool in 2015.
- provides the actor with the ability to escalate privileges, harvest credentials, exfiltrate information and move laterally across a network. 
- has become increasingly popular among state actors and organized crime groups
- has recently been observed in a number of global incidents across a wide range of sectors.

### Command and Control Obfuscators
- Malicious cyber actors will typically want to disguise their location when compromising a target. They may use generic privacy tools such as TOR, or more specific tools to obfuscate their location.

#### HUC Packet Transmitter (HTran)
- a tool used to proxy connections. 
- has been freely available on the internet since at least 2009
- designed to obfuscate an adversary’s communications with victim networks
- The use of HTran has been regularly observed in compromises of both government and industry targets.





**Lesson proper**
# Governance and Risk Management
## Asset
- all existing hardware
	- servers
	- computer
- all software used
	- applications used in your daily life
- all data and information gathered in order for the system to fully functions
- assets are a crown jewel
	- they are the most vulnerable and critical when it comes to IT sector
	- because of the Data itself

### Security Breach
- Full access of specific computer
- violates CIA triad
### Data Breach
- access only information

## Activities Caused by the Security Breach
### DoS - Denial-of-Service
- see the advance study
- easier to mitigate

### DDoS - Distributed DoS
- Multiple computers
- harder to stop
- massive diseuptions
- harder to trace

### Unacceptable Web Browsing
- visiting malicious or illegal websites
### WireTapping
- Intercepting private communications
- enter your calls
- emails
- messages
- chats
### Backdoors Attack
- Accessing first the Backdoors
- hide the identity
- Backdoors - Database

### Data Modification
- Modifies data without permission
- Spyware
	- targets your confidential data and can do specific actions

## 3 Types of Hackers
Hackers - anyone with professional skills to access assets without any authorization
### Black Hat
- Unethical
- illegal
- advance knowledge in destroying networks
- create their own malwares
### White Hat
- Ethical
- hired in a company
### Gray Hat
- combination of black and white
- creates their own malware and they fix it themselves

### Hackers vs Crackers
### Hackers
- professional
### Crackers
- someone who violates rules and security breaches
- unprofessional 

## Tools used by Hackers
### Protocol analyzer
- or pocket sniffers
- used to monitor and capture network traffics
