# Cryptography
- practice of encoding information so that it can only be read by the intended recipient through encrypting and decrypting process
- practice of communication through communicating
## Importance of Cryptography
- Security
- Privacy in communication

## History of Cryptography
### first used if crypto
- mesopotamian
	- tablets
	- used for hiding recipes
- egyptians
	- obscure symbols in order to hide messages
- greek skytale
	- during war, 
	- used in military
	- use parchment to encrypt message
- romans
	- caesar cypher
	- shifting letters in alphabet by a fixed number
### medieval period
- AI Kindi (9th Century)
	- Develop the technique of frequency analysis
	- breaking substitution cipher
- European Renaissance
	- Rise of polyalphabetic cipher
		- vigenēre cipher
### Cryptography in Modern Era
- Vigenēre cipher (1553)
	- Multiple alphabetics for encoding
	- Introduce complexity to cryptanalysis
- 19th Century Innovation
	- Mechanical device for encryption
	- Telegraphy (for secure communication)
### World Wars
- World War 1
	- use of mechanical cipher (enigma)
- World war 2
	- Code breaking (Bletchley Park efforts)
	- Alan Turing developed method yo decrypt Enigma codes
### Rise of Digital Cryptography
- 1960s - 1970s
	- Computers revolutionized cryptographic techniques
	- **DES (1977)**: First Standardized symmetric encryption algorithm
- Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange (1976)
	- Introduced Public Key cryptography
	- Allowed secure communication over open networks
### Modern Cryptography
- RSA (Rivest - Shamir - Adleman) Algorithm (1977)
	- Based on mathematical difficulty of factoring large numbers
	- cornerstone of secure digital communication
- **AES (advanced encryption standard)** 2001
	- replaced DES
	- widely used for secure transaction
- Quantum Cryptography
	- to ensure security
	- unbreakable encryption techniques
### The Future of Cryptography
- Challenges if Quantum computing
	- Threatens current encryption method
- Post - Quantum Cryptography
	- Development of algorithms resistant to quantum attacks
- Role of AI
	- Enhance cryptographic systems
	- Improved cryptanalysis got detecting vulnerabilities

## Morris Worm Attack
- November 1988
- first DDoS attack
- 6,000 computers affected out of 60,000

### Types of Dos Attack
- Penetration
- eavesdropping
	- wiretapping
	- getting data only
- man in the middle
	- realtime
- flooding
	- cause traffic on the server
