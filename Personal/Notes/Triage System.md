# Key Principle
- The order in which you do things matters more than how many things you got done
- The work never stops
- The problem is not we have too much to do, the problem is we are trying to do everything

# Triage System
Tackling things in order of priority

# Six Core Principles
## 1. The Daily Reset
- fresh todo list every day
- The messiness of the todo list was the point
	- is this important enough for me to take action non today?
- A scratch paper / notebook is better for this

## 2. The Box Method
- create a box every time you have a to do
- different box state 
	- empty - not started
	- middle cross - started
	- half shade - 50% completed
	- filled & word crossed - completed
- my box state in obsidian
	- [ ] empty
	- [-] started
	- [+] half complete
	- [x] complete

## 3. Real-Time Triage
- To do the most important things first
- What is the next most important priority right now?
- Be okay with things dropping
- Is what I'm about to do really the most important thing?
- Our real goal is prioritizing the most important things
### Urgent-Important Matrix
- Urgent && Important 
	- Do
- ! Urgent && ! Important 
	- Ignore
- ! Urgent && Important 
	- The truly important stuff is rarely urgent
- Urgent && ! Important 
	- The truly urgent stuff is rarely important
- Urgent && ! Important < ! Urgent && Important
