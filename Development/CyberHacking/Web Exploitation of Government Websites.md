# Brute Force
- When hackers or bots use trial and error to continually attempt to access your site.
- guessing hundreds of password and username combinations until they find the right one.
- allows attackers to gain admin privileges for your application.

# DDoS
- Distributed Denial of Service
- A cyber attack on a specific server or network
- Intended purpose of disrupting normal operation
- flooding the target with a constant flood of traffic
	- Fraudulent requests
- DoS (Denial of Service)
	- comes from one attacker
	- can be handled by the server, easier to pinpoint
- DDoS
	- multiple attackers all at once
	- harder to handle by the server
- Eat ups the servers system resources
	- CPU
	- Ram
	- Network bandwidth
- Other computers will be denied of services because of DDoS
- can last for hours or days, depending on the attacker's intent
## How it works
- Using malware program and distribute over the internet and put it on websites and email attachments
- Botnet - an army of infected computers to do a DDoS attack.
	- can be thousands
	- can be controlled by the attacker
	- waiting to receive orders
## Why
- financial reasons.
- Political reasons.
- For fun.

# DNS Poisoning or Spoofing
- Domain Name System (DNS)
	- an encrypted protocol that translates domain names (gensan.com) into readable IP addresses.
	- easy for hackers to intercept through spoofing or poisoning.
- By default, DNS servers don't validate the IP address to which they're redirected. 
## How it works
- Hackers can alter DNS records to redirect visitors to a malicious site that resembles the intended destination.
- When you arrive at a malicious site, you're often prompted to log in, tricking users to believe that they are logging in to a legitimate account.
- malicious sites can also be used to install viruses on the visitor's computer.
## How to prevent it
- end to end encryption
- DNSSEC protection

# SQL Injection
- A vulnerability that is easily avoidable but most developers does not know this.
- SQL - Language that communicates with Databases
- with this attack, you can insert SQL in your websites.
	- possibly delete all your data

# Injection Flaws
