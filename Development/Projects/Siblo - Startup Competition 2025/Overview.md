***Title:*** Siblo – Learn, Battle, Evolve 

***Concept:*** A gamified learning platform where each student has ***one personal monster*** that evolves based on their academic progress. Students level up their monster by answering teacher-provided or AI-generated questions, then use their monster to battle classmates in ***Pokémon-style turn-based matches***. 

***How It Works:*** 
1. ***Teacher Side*** 
	- Upload lessons or modules. 
	- AI summarizes content and auto-generates a question bank. 
	- Teacher reviews and publishes questions. 
2. ***Student Side*** 
	- Learn the lessons in class. - Answer questions on the platform to earn XP. - Monster evolves along ***subject-specific paths*** (Math, Science, English, Arts). - Battle classmates in short turn-based matches. 
3. ***Gameplay Layers*** 
	- ***Core Mechanics (for younger students)***: Simple 1v1 turn-based combat, 4 moves, basic stats.
	- ***Advanced Mechanics (for older students)***: Status effects, subject-based elemental advantages, skill customization, passive abilities, and resource management. 
4. ***Motivation Loop***
	- Learn → Answer Questions → Earn XP → Monster Evolves → Battle → Show Off Progress → Repeat. 

***Value Proposition:*** 
- For ***students***: Fun, competitive, and emotionally engaging learning experience. - For ***teachers***: AI-assisted lesson prep, automatic question generation, performance tracking. - For ***schools***: Higher engagement and measurable academic improvement. 

***Monetization Ideas:*** 
- School subscriptions for AI features & analytics. 
- Cosmetic skins for monsters (no pay-to-win). - 
- Seasonal events with limited-edition evolutions. 

# Battle Mechanics 
- turn based with a twist 
- pwede sila mag lihok during sa turn nila
