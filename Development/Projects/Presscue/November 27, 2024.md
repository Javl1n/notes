- Advocate ICT Industry Development specially the country side
	- ICT is not just software and hardware, also: 
		- ITBPM or Outsourcing
		- Creative Industry
			- Animation
			- Esports
			- E-comic
			- VR
		- Semi-conductors Industry
		- Start Up Industry

## Current Initiatives to Support Startups
### LGU ICT Gensan

- Legislation only on Gensan
- Consultative meeting
	- must be ammended to taylor fit the current generation
- Acadeems, Change their way of thinking to incorporate the technological careers na kailangan nila malaman

#### Programs
- Legislation
- Supportive sa programs
- Little by little introduced the world of ITBPM
- If may maisip kayo na batas na pwede ma legislate, just say something

### DICT
- anong Itsura ng STARTUP Ecosystem
	- Through Activities
	- Initiatives
	- Stakeholders
	- Investors
- Awareness Activities
	- Schools
	- Simple Workshop
- Share the Opportunities about startups, innovations
- Acceleration Support
	- Not yet in Gensan / Region 12
- National Pitching Competition
	- Focused on the Students
- 2nd Quarter to 4th Quarter Regional Pitching
- Bootcamp for Teachers and Mentors

		- 0 interest

## Assessment of Startup Ecosystem
### Current Challenges in Promoting Commercialization
- Knowledge Gap, not advanced enough
	- Compared to highly develop areas: manila, cebu; and foreign country
	- Anything could happen in startup, no structure
		- Opposite in our mindset, structured ang acadeem,
		- Startups usually are trailblazers
- Lack of Support
	- you cannot survive on your own
	- you need the ecosystem
	- if we can establish a strong connection between important stakeholders
		- acadeem is called feeder
			- developers or founders galing dito
		- enablers
			- government
		- mentors
- if they will be limited with the barriers, they will be limited with their journeys
- Ayusin young team muna.
### Struggles in creating a thriving ecosystem
- Market of their skills
	- start with the end in mind, may target na gustong kunin
	- provide people avenue where they could pitch
	- venture capitalists
	- Government: enhance budget, skills as part of corporate requirement
	- maximize talent
- Let the private sector know that there is a bandwagon of startup
: Pati ang government wala pay full information / experience sa startup
- Gensan will not just be a tuna capital, they will go into economic diversification
	- open manifacturing
	- retail and service industries
- **FIND YOUR NICHE**
- Gensan will be going into transformation stage
- How can startup connect with the logistics?
- we need to have a movement not just private sector, but also government, and other sectors
	- we are on the track, the only problem is hindi natin nabalikan
	- main reason is nawala ang ICT council
- Kulang sa exposure and kulang sa entrepreneurial mindset
	- naa pa sa mindset of being a student
- process of legislation is not fast
	- need to organize
- we need to strengthen our ICT
### How much is the grant fund
- 500k to 1M per STARTUP

# PART 2: Private Industry's Role in Scaling Startups
## What support do you offer for startups
### Sir Lord Dalinas
- Acceleration Program: Launch Online
	- We have an opportunity to sell startups globally rather than here
	- because mas daghan requirements sa local government, it's easier to sell for foreign companies and agencies.

### Sir Clint
- Mentoring
- Get Ready: Biggest ICT Summit in Mindanao Will happen in 2025, in Koronodal
	- June 19-21, 2025

### Sir Prim
- Accelerator Programs
	- Mentorship
	- Do not Create a program just because you have a budget, just because you have a startup
	- start ups is not for everyone.
- Incubation Program: Rirgorous Workshop for Startups.
	- A startup with a facebook page is not a legit startup
	- Inherit a program that is resilient, that produces outcome.
	- some brainwash startups to sell to investments.
	- does not charge professional fees
		- does not charge equity ....
- Challenge for startups: try to behave like the very stakeholders you wish to serve

##  Develop a thriving startup ecosystem
### Sir Lord
- Continuity
	- Gensan is groomed to be the alternative spot for ICT
	- Main reason why we are huli
		- continuity programs are fading
			- because change of leadership
			- change of focus in the industry
	- Convening everyone
	- if private sector is not active, lgu can remind the Private sect, and vice versa
		- There should be a balance.

### Sir Clint
- Private and Government - 50/50
	- if anything happens in the government, the co-chair is there
		- if there is a change in leadership, etc.
		- there is speed IT to support, and advice(?)
- Focus on Smart Governance.
	- Smart City or Digital City is nothing if wala ang Smart Governance.
- Why not put sa billboard, instead of politicians, the Statistics of Mayor.

### Sir Prim
- They pitch an idea on assumption that a support will be given to them, without support they will be dead
- your foundation should not be on assumptions.
- Israel is not focused on smart cities, but on **Smart Founders**
- What is lacking in the Philippines is good, problem-centric, scalable startups.
#### Create smart people first.
- 1. Build your own investors
	- Foundation First.
	- Form a community of investors.
	- Business Investment Readiness Development Track.
- 2. Work with National Government Agency
	- Different Institutions come and go, but not government institution.
- 3. Multi-Sectorally Built
- 4. Create Smart Startup
