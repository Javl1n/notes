## Part Three - UI Design vs. UX Design vs. Web Design

### Definition of terms
#Frontend/definition tanan design, buttons, links, colors, typographies, shapes etc. is the front end
#Frontend/definition is incharge of frontend of website/webapp

#Backend/definition The engine that drives the whole experience, the functionality sa system
#Backend/definition**Web Developer/Web Engineer** : ang ga deal sa backend

#UX/definition**User Experience**: includes *information architecture*, *user psychology*, *usability testing*, *content strategy*, *wireframes*, *interaction design*, etc.
#UX/definition  in charge of creating/designing the frontend of a website from a user's perspective.

#UI/Definition **User Interface**: Also part of the frontend pero more focus sila sa visual aspect. focuses on things like *color*, *typography*, *spacing*, *sizing*, *shape*, etc.
#UI/Definition  taking the structures defined by the ux designers and dressing them up with colors, typography, etc.

### Notes
#UX/tips  **Less is more**. for example sa registration. mas better kung dili sa registration mismo i fill up tanan user information, mas better email and password lang sa then ifill up ra dayun nila sa profile section. This does make sense, kay rag bad design kaayo ang daghan na form. although dako kaayo na chance na malimtan siya sa user, pero ma combat mana nga problem if we set up some alert to them na please complete their information.

### Key Takeawas


## Part Four - Learing to Work with Project Briefs
#UX/definition **Project Brief**: the structure of the website and tells who we're designing for. gives all information we need for the project

### Key Takeaways
 
## Part Five - Working with Wireframes
In wireframe we don't focus on aesthetic: colors, typefaces, spacing, sizing.
purely representing the content, the structure
UX

purpose of the wireframe is to display the content
